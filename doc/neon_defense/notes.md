-> Spawn enemies through a "portal"

-> Always spawn two pieces at a time with an orientation

# Big questions:
-> The balance between the slow maze building and the fast/minimalistic action


Possible directions:
-> No skip, focus on the maze building/puzzle solving
    -> Tetris-like game
-> Skip and focus on the action
    -> Slot machine-like game
-> Skip as cooldown + reward


# Things to remember/contraints:
-> Respect the player's time, make sure the game never completely blocks the player
-> Make sure that each action comes with a meaningful decision for the player
    - Skip is not a meaninful decision
