### Core Gameplay Mechanics

- **Energy Management**: The player's main resource is energy, which depletes over time. Managing this resource effectively is key to survival.
- **Threat Level Manipulation**: Unlike traditional tower defenses where waves are automatic, players must manually spawn portals to call on enemy waves. Calling more waves increases their system's threat level, thus generating more energy but at a greater risk.
- **Base Defense**: The player's base must be protected by constructing a maze with various defensive buildings and towers.
- **Rogue-like Elements**: The game will randomly generate both the available towers and enemies, similarly to how pieces appears in Tetris. Forcing the player to accommodate with what the game gives them.

## Game objective

Survive during a given duration by spawning enough enemies waves to keep energy levels above a minimum while constructing defenses to protect the central base.
Maximize scored points by maintaining the [threat level] as high as possible.
